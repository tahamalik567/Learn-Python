# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# BMI Wikipedia Page

# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):


# NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.

# Example Input 1

# 1.75
# 80
# means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
height=float(height)
weight=float(weight)
bmi = weight / (height * height)
# or 
bmi = weight / height ** 2
print(round(bmi))
