# Instructions
# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

# You have x weeks left.
# Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.

# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# Example Input
# 56
# Example Output
# You have 1768 weeks left.

age = input()
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
# Write your code below this line 👇
# 1 year = 52 weeks 
# 90 - age * 52 
print(f"You have {(90-int(age))*52} weeks left.")
